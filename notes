It is seems that .unshift becomes increasingly inneficient with greater volumes of data, whereas appending onto the end of an array seems to be much more efficient in this context. This is to be expected since adding to the beginning of the array requires a far greater amount of work due to having to shift the values down the entire array. I found that they performed in equal capacity for the two smallest arrays.
